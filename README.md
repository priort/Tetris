# Two Tetromino Tetris
A version of Tetris written in F# with Fable with support for two tetrominoes and their rotations for this first version.

The rotation algorithm differs from the original game in this first version.
It handles wall kicks but, if there are other blocks in the way of the rotation,
even after a wall kick, the rotation is not performed.
